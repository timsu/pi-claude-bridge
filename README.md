# pi-claude-bridge

Run Claude Code as a Pi provider. Adds `claude-bridge/*` models to `/model` and routes Pi turns through the Claude Agent SDK while keeping Pi's tools and TUI.

Fork of [`@vanillagreen/pi-claude-bridge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vanillagreen/pi-claude-bridge) (originally by vanillagreencom). That package lives inside a private monorepo; this fork extracts it as a standalone public package so it can receive targeted patches without depending on monorepo tooling.

## Why fork

The upstream bridge uses module-level singletons (`_ctx` in `query-state.ts`, `sharedSession` in `index.ts`) for all LLM query state. That works fine when Pi runs one task at a time. When a host daemon runs multiple concurrent tasks in the same Node.js process — e.g. a Manta worker daemon handling two cards simultaneously — the singletons are shared across all in-flight `backend.runTurn()` calls. The second task's turn start clobbers the first task's active stream reference and session state, causing the first task to silently stall.

This fork fixes that by wrapping `_ctx` and `contextStack` in a Node.js `AsyncLocalStorage` so each top-level call to `streamClaudeAgentSdk` gets its own isolated query context. Subagent reentrancy (`pushContext`/`popContext`) continues to work as before, scoped within each turn's own storage slot.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@timsu/pi-claude-bridge
```

Restart Pi after installation.

## Highlights

- `claude-bridge/claude-fable-5`, Opus 4.8, Opus 4.7, Sonnet, and Haiku in `/model`.
- Pi tool calls run on Pi; Claude Code handles reasoning.
- Tool-use turns block until Pi-delivered tool results reach Claude Code, including persistent subagent panes.
- Session continuity across normal turns, `/compact`, tree navigation, and abort recovery.
- Thinking-level forwarding with summarized Opus thinking display.
- Optional Claude effort overrides (`xhigh` → `max` for Opus 4.8).
- MCP isolation and Claude cloud-MCP suppression to keep tokens lean.
- Opt-in forwarding of `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` and recognized Pi prompt hooks.
- **Concurrent-task isolation**: per-turn `AsyncLocalStorage` context so multiple concurrent tasks in one process don't corrupt each other's query state.

## Settings

Open `/extensions:settings`; settings appear under the **Claude Bridge** tab.

### General

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Enable Claude bridge provider | Register `claude-bridge/*` models. Reload required. |

### Base prompt

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Forward AGENTS.md + skills | Append AGENTS.md and Pi's skills block. |

### Pi prompt context

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Forward APPEND_SYSTEM.md | Forward project/global `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` content. |

### Pi prompt hooks

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Forward project agents hook | Forward `pi-agents-tmux` Project Agents/Subagents list. |
| Forward task panel hook | Forward `pi-task-panel` workflow reminders. |
| Forward caveman hook | Forward `pi-caveman` response-style directives. |

### Claude Code

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Strict MCP config | Block filesystem MCP auto-loads; Pi owns tools. |
| Allow extra usage helper | Let the bridge launch Claude Code's `/extra-usage` flow when extra usage is required. |
| Fast mode | Enable Claude Code fast mode for bridge requests when the selected model supports it. |
| Force Claude effort | Override Pi's thinking-level mapping for every claude-bridge request. `none` keeps Pi's selected level; `max` sends Claude Code `--effort max`. |
| Model effort overrides | JSON object mapping model IDs to Claude Code efforts, e.g. `{"claude-opus-4-8":"max"}`. |
| Claude executable path | Explicit `claude` binary path; empty auto-detects. |

## Debugging

Set `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` to write bridge logs to `~/.pi/agent/claude-bridge.log` and per-query Claude Code CLI logs under `~/.pi/agent/cc-cli-logs/`.
